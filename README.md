this is for the capstone project. the dataset is from https://github.com/TQRG/VDET-for-Java and was downloaded from the public google drive shared folder of Claudia R Mamede (who is the owner) as part of her TQRG's 2022 paper on java vulnerability detection. it is based on the NIST Juliet for Java dataset, which TQRG has preprocessed into .csv format. We have likewise preprocessed the OWASP Benchmark 1.2 dataset into a matching .xlsx spreadsheet.

our own work is in the notebooks.
